Chapter 84 Reward

As the elevator doors slid open with a soft ding, the group stepped inside. Cedric scanned the sleek interior, eyes wide with admiration. "Even the elevator feels like something out of a noble's mansion," he muttered.

The elevator ascended smoothly, stopping at the first floor. Arthur and Alicia stepped out, the doors closing behind them as Kaela and Cedric continued to the next level.

Arthur glanced around the hallway, which was bathed in soft golden light from ornate wall sconces. The floor housed fifteen rooms, each one tailored for first-year students. Elegant wooden doors, polished to a gleam, bore the room numbers engraved in gold. The common area at the center featured plush sofas, a grand bookshelf, and a fireplace that crackled softly, filling the space with warmth and a touch of homeliness.

"Looks like we're here," Arthur said, taking in the luxurious surroundings.

Alicia stopped in front of her door, Room S-21. She turned to Arthur with a gentle smile. "See you tomorrow. Don't sleep too late."

"I won't," Arthur replied with a nod. "Goodnight, Alicia."

"Goodnight," she said before stepping inside her room, the door clicking shut behind her.

Arthur continued down the hallway until he reached his own room—S-1, the room reserved for the top-ranked student.

I unlocked the door and stepped into my new room, my eyes immediately scanning the space.

Luxurious. Spacious. Refined.

Arcane Academy really spared no expense in ensuring the comfort and prestige of its elite residents. The room was furnished with the finest materials—silk sheets, polished marble floors, intricately carved wood, and soft ambient lighting.

Even though I had grown up surrounded by luxury in the Ludwig mansion, I couldn't help but be impressed. This wasn't just a dorm room. It was a statement of the academy's commitment to its top students.

I dropped my bag near the bed and sat down, trying to gather my thoughts. It had been a long day. The entrance ceremony, the tour, meeting new faces—it was all starting to blur together.

I leaned back slightly, closing my eyes. Finally, some peace.

Then, a familiar voice broke through the quiet.

"Arthur…"

I froze, my eyes snapping open.

Sol?

But something was different this time. Her voice wasn't echoing directly in my mind. Instead, it sounded… close. Too close.

Coming from my right.

I turned my head, expecting to find nothing. Instead, I saw a small blur perched on my shoulder.

What the…?

Without thinking, I instinctively swatted it away.

"What the fuck?!" I muttered, my heart skipping a beat. I watched as the tiny figure tumbled off my shoulder and landed on the floor with a soft thud.

"OUCH! OUCH!" a high-pitched voice whined in protest.

I blinked, my eyes finally focusing on the figure.

There, on the floor, squatting and rubbing her head, was a tiny fairy.

A fairy.

She was no larger than my hand, with translucent wings that shimmered like glass under the room's soft light. Her hair, a cascade of silvery-blue, framed her delicate face, and her skin glowed faintly, as if she carried a spark of magic within her.

But what caught my attention—what kept my attention—was her attire.

Her short, provocative dress clung to her petite, flawless figure. The fabric, woven from soft, silken petals, barely covered what it was supposed to, leaving just enough exposed to ignite curiosity. It shifted and flowed with her every movement, teasing glimpses of smooth, toned legs and slender curves that seemed far too perfect for something so small.

She arched her tiny hands, groaning softly as she checked herself for any wounds.

"What… what the hell are you?" I managed to ask, still half in shock.

Experience exclusive tales on empire

As I stood there, still trying to process the sudden appearance of a tiny fairy, her eyes locked with mine in a sharp glare.

Before I could react, she shot toward me with surprising speed, her tiny fists clenched.

"What now?" I muttered, watching her approach.

She flew right up to my face, her wings fluttering furiously.

"You threw me!" she shouted, raising her fist.

I blinked. Is she… about to punch me?

Curious, and a bit amused, I leaned forward, offering my cheek. "Go ahead. Let's see how much that tiny fist of yours can hurt."

Her eyes narrowed, and a faint glow began to radiate from her fist.

Wait… glow?

Before I could rethink my decision, her fist connected with my cheek.

BAM!

The world spun.

Literally.

I was sent flying backward, crashing into the wall with a loud thud.

"Ahhh!"

"Fuck!" I groaned, slumping to the floor. My head throbbed, and my cheek burned from the unexpected impact.

I raised a shaky hand, casting a quick healing spell. "[Heal]." The magic worked instantly, soothing the worst of the pain.

Still rubbing my cheek, I glared at the little menace hovering in the air. "What the hell was that?"

She crossed her arms and smirked. "That settles the score."

I stared at her, incredulous. "Settles the score?"

She shrugged, as if it was obvious. "You were the one who started it. I was just balancing the scales."

"What do you mean I started it? You landed on my shoulder without warning! I thought you were a bug, and I instinctively swatted you."

Her eyes flared with indignation. "Bug?! You're the bug!"

"Yeah, yeah… go look in a mirror, Tinkerbell."

She scoffed, her wings fluttering indignantly. "Who the fuck are you calling Tinkerbell?"

I waved a hand dismissively. "Whatever. Who the hell are you anyway?"

Her jaw dropped. "Seriously, Arthur? I was gone for one day and you already forgot me?"

I blinked again, recognition finally sinking in.

"…Sol?"

The fairy straightened, brushing herself off with a huff. "Yes, it's me. Sol. Your partner. Your guide. And now, apparently, your target practice." She crossed her arms, pouting. "Not exactly the grand welcome I was expecting."

She flew closer, landing delicately on my shoulder like nothing had happened. Her tiny frame barely weighed anything, but the smugness she radiated was palpable.

"What the fuck happened to you?" I asked, still bewildered. "Why do you look like this?"

Sol crossed her legs, resting one hand on her hip. "Oh~ this?" She spun around, letting me get a full view of her miniature but curvaceous figure. "This is the result of my upgrade! I got my own physical body. No more being trapped in your head. Cool, right?"

I blinked, still processing. "…Yeah. Cool." Then another thought hit me. "Wait. If you're out here, how will you track my missions and stats?"

She giggled, tapping the side of my head. "Oh~ don't worry about that. My core is still in your mind. It tracks everything. I'm just… a clone. Think of me as a physical extension."

I nodded slowly. "Huh. That's… convenient."

She beamed. "See? I'm awesome."

Then, she leaned in, her lips curling into a playful smirk. "So… did you miss me?"

I paused, meeting her gaze. "…Yes."

Her eyes widened in surprise, then softened. "Ow~ How cute." She reached up and pinched my cheek with her tiny hands.

I swatted her hand away. "Don't get cheeky. I was only missing my rewards, not you."

Her playful demeanor faded into a pout. "How rude."

She crossed her arms, muttering, "Tch~ You could have just lied."

Despite the complaint, she waved her tiny hand, and the translucent system window popped up with all the details.

"Hm~ Let's see," she murmured, hovering in front of me and scanning the list. "Which missions did you manage to clear?"
