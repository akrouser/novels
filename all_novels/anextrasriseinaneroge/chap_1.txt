Chapter 83 Dormitory

Emily led the group through the academy, her enthusiasm never waning as she pointed out every notable place along the way.

"Welcome to the Training Grounds," she announced, spreading her arms wide. The vast expanse stretched before them, filled with sparring areas, obstacle courses, and arenas for duels. Students were already hard at work, their movements sharp and precise.

Cedric whistled. "This place is huge."

Emily grinned. "Wait until you see the classrooms."

She took them next to the Classroom Wing, where sleek, modern rooms were equipped with floating chalkboards and magical interfaces. "These are where most of your lectures will be held. Each classroom is enchanted for interactive learning."

Kaela's eyes widened. "I've never seen anything like this."

"You'll get used to it," Emily said with a wink.

They continued the tour, visiting the Auditorium, a grand hall with high ceilings and enchanted lighting, followed by the Research Labs, where students in white robes worked on intricate magical experiments.

"These are the Magic Engineering Labs," Emily explained as they passed through another set of doors. Inside, students tinkered with mechanical constructs infused with magic, creating devices that whirred and sparked with energy.

Alicia leaned closer to Arthur. "I could spend hours in here."

Emily then guided them to the Alchemy Room, filled with shelves of glowing potions and exotic ingredients. The air was thick with the scent of herbs and magic.

"Everything here is state-of-the-art," Emily said proudly. "The academy spares no expense."

Finally, they arrived at the Cafeteria. The space was vast, with long tables and a variety of food stations offering dishes from different regions.

"Let's grab something to eat," Emily suggested, leading them to a table after they collected their meals. The group chatted and enjoyed their food, the tour leaving them both impressed and eager to explore more.

As they finished their meal, a soft ding echoed from Emily's wrist. Everyone's attention shifted to her.

Emily casually tapped the device strapped around her wrist, and a holographic image of Oliver Hestia appeared above it.

"Emily, where are you? Report to the Student Council office," Oliver's holographic figure commanded, his tone firm.

"Yes, yes, I'll be there soon," Emily replied nonchalantly and ended the call with a tap.

Everyone stared at her, wide-eyed.

"What was that?" Alicia asked, breaking the silence.

"What?" Emily tilted her head, confused.

"That!" Cedric pointed at her wrist.

"Oh, this?" Emily glanced at the band casually. "It's an Arcana Band, developed by the Magic Engineering students. Think of it like having your Aetherpod on your wrist. Pretty cool, right?"

"Yeah, it is," Kaela nodded, her eyes still fixed on the device.

"Where can we get one?" Cedric asked, curiosity sparking in his eyes.

Emily chuckled. "Oh, they're not available to the public."

Cedric's excitement deflated. "Seriously?"

Emily grinned. "Relax—you'll get one in your first class. They're exclusive to the academy."

"That's awesome," Alicia said, clearly impressed.

Emily stood, brushing off her skirt. "Well, it was nice meeting you all, but I have to go. Duty calls."

She turned to Arthur with a playful smile. "See you later, little brother." Leaning in, she planted a quick kiss on his cheek, making him flush slightly.

Before Arthur could respond, Emily waved and walked off.

Cedric smirked. "Your sister is so sweet. Why can't Alicia be like her?"

Thud!

Alicia's fist met Cedric's head.

"What did you say?" she asked, narrowing her eyes.

"Ow! No, no! I meant you're the sweetest sister ever!" Cedric stammered, rubbing his head.

Arthur and Kaela burst into laughter, while Alicia's glare softened into a smirk.

"Smooth," Kaela teased.

"Barely," Cedric muttered, relieved to have escaped further punishment.

After finishing their meal, Kaela stretched her arms and let out a soft yawn. "Should we check out our dormitories? I'm pretty tired and could really use a nap."

"Sounds like a plan," Arthur agreed, pushing back his chair.

The group left the cafeteria, stepping outside into the cool evening air. The sky had shifted to a warm yellow-orange, casting long shadows across the academy grounds. They walked along the stone pathway leading to the back of the academy, where several dormitory buildings stood.

Cedric let out a low whistle as they approached. "Is this where we're staying? Looks fancy enough from the outside."

Arthur nodded. "Let's see if it lives up to the impression inside."

They entered through the grand oak doors into a spacious, well-lit lobby with polished marble floors and intricate chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The air carried the faint scent of lavender, adding to the dormitory's opulent atmosphere.

As they took in their surroundings, a soft, mature voice chimed from their left, pulling their attention.

"Hoho, do we have new first-years here?"

Turning, they saw a woman approaching. Petite in height, with a round face and warm hazel eyes, she carried herself with a calm grace. Her black hair flowed down her back, and she wore a simple yet elegant uniform.

"She's beautiful," Cedric muttered under his breath. Arthur silently agreed but kept his expression neutral.

"Yes, we are," Arthur responded politely.

The woman smiled. "Welcome to your new home. I'm Camila Madison, the warden of this dormitory." She gestured for them to follow her toward a desk situated at the far end of the lobby, near the corridor leading to the common room.

They followed her, their footsteps echoing softly in the quiet space. Camila took a seat behind the desk and powered on a sleek, glass-like device that resembled a futuristic computer. Her fingers moved gracefully over the screen.

"Names?" she asked, her gaze shifting between them.

"Arthur Ludwig."

"Cedric Raven."

"Alicia Raven." Stay connected with empire

"Kaela Howler."

Camila nodded, quickly checking the list of assigned rooms.

"Student Alicia Raven," she began, her voice clear and professional, "you've been allotted room S-21 on the first floor, based on your student ranking."

Alicia smiled in satisfaction. "Thank you."

"Student Arthur Ludwig, you've been allotted room S-1, also on the first floor."

Cedric raised an eyebrow. "S-1? That sounds prestigious."

Arthur remained composed. "Perks of getting first rank."

Camila continued, "Student Cedric Raven, you've been allotted room S-56. And Student Kaela Howler, S-45. Both on the same floor."

"Oh~ We're also getting S-Class dorms?" Cedric said, his voice laced with excitement as he flashed a grin at the others.

Hearing this, Camila clicked her tongue, her smile turning into a playful yet sharp smirk. "Tsk~"

Cedric froze, sensing a reprimand coming.

"You're only allotted S-Class dormitories because of your noble lineage. Based on your rankings, you should have been assigned to C-Class dorms," she said, her tone dripping with a touch of sarcasm.

The words hit their mark. Cedric fell silent, looking up at the ceiling, suddenly very aware of the awkward tension. His grin faltered, and a flush of embarrassment crept across his face.

Camila looked up from the screen, her warm smile returning. "That's all set. Your rooms are ready. Please take some time to settle in and familiarize yourself with the dormitory. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out."

"Thank you," Arthur said, the others echoing his sentiment.

As they turned to leave, Camila added with a slight smile, "And welcome to the academy. I'm sure you'll find it… eventful."

The group walked down the brightly lit hallway toward the elevator, their footsteps soft against the polished marble floor. As they waited for the lift, Arthur's thoughts drifted to the structure of the dormitories—specifically the S-Class dormitory they were now in.

Dormitory Divisions and Privileges

The S-Class dormitory wasn't just another student accommodation—it was the pinnacle of comfort and privilege. Reserved for students with S-grade evaluations, it catered to the top 20 ranked students from all three years.

The dorm was divided as follows:

First & Second Floors: Flats for first-year students, offering expansive living spaces and high-end amenities.

Third & Fourth Floors: Reserved for second-year students, each flat becoming progressively more luxurious and refined.

Fifth & Sixth Floors: Housing third-year and final-year students, these floors were practically miniature palaces with breathtaking views of the academy grounds.

The remaining floors housed various exclusive facilities available only to S-Class students, such as:

Private Gyms equipped with the latest magical and physical training equipment.

Private Pools for relaxation and stamina-building exercises.

Private Meditation Rooms designed to enhance mana control and mental clarity.

Mini Gardens imbued with nature magic, providing a serene environment for study and reflection.

VR Cabins offering immersive combat simulations and training programs tailored to each student's skill level.

Access to high-grade spiritual meals crafted from rare ingredients to boost physical and magical abilities.

A steady supply of resources like pills, potions, and weapons, all tailored to their individual needs.

Private Training Rooms for honing combat skills in privacy, with direct guidance from top-tier teaching faculty when requested.

Below the S-Class dormitory in rank were five other dormitories, each designed to reflect the students' grades and rankings:

A Grade Dorm (Rank 21 – 50): Privileges included a normal flat, access to a private gym, VR cabins, high-grade meals, and moderate resources like pills and potions.

B Grade Dorm (Rank 51 – 100): Students here were allotted single-room flats with VR headgear for virtual training and basic resources like healing potions and low-tier weapons.

C Grade Dorm (Rank 101 – 200): Accommodation consisted of single rooms, with limited access to VR gear and basic communal facilities.

D Grade Dorm (Rank 201 – 350): Shared two-person rooms, with males and females housed separately. Access to facilities was limited but available through earned merits.

E Grade Dorm (Rank 351 – 600): Shared five-person rooms, offering only basic living conditions with few amenities, and separate quarters for male and female students.

Facilities for All Students

While the higher-ranked dorms provided significant advantages, many of the academy's core facilities, such as the grand library, the alchemy labs, and basic training grounds, were accessible to all students. Additionally, students from lower grades could access premium facilities by earning merit points through academic excellence, competitions, or other contributions to the academy.

Lastly, nobles who brought personal attendants or maids had a separate floor dedicated to housing their servants, ensuring their comfort and well-being without disrupting the students' living spaces.
